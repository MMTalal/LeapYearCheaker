# Leap Year Checker

## Description
The Leap Year Checker is a simple Python script that allows users to input a year and determines whether that year is a leap year or not.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter a year
- Checks if the given year is a leap year
- Prints the result to the console (whether the year is a leap year or not)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `Leap Year Checker.py` file.
2. Open the file in a Python environment (e.g., a code editor, Python terminal, or Jupyter Notebook).
3. Run the script.
4. When prompted, enter a year and press Enter.
5. The script will output whether the given year is a leap year or not.

## Example
```
Enter the year: 2024
2024 is a leap year, it is 366 days.
```

## How it Works
The script uses the following logic to determine if a year is a leap year:
- If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
- If the year is not divisible by 100 but is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
- If the year doesn't meet either of these criteria, it is not a leap year.
